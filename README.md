# Whomst dareth approach my profile? :anger:

### Leave immediately, lest you be exposed to the following:

- :books: Incredibly well structured and documented Node.js repositories.
- :trophy: The best Svelte progressive web apps you've ever seen.
- :desktop_computer: Hackathon projects you never knew you needed in your life.
- :robot: Borderline useful discord bots.
- :chart_with_upwards_trend: Stats. So many stats.

### Still not convinced?

Take a look at one of my latest projects; :spider:[WeaverFi](https://github.com/WeaverFi). That'll show ya.

Perhaps a glimpse of some apps I made for PoolTogether? Take [this](https://github.com/Ncookiez/pooltogether-stats)! And [this](https://github.com/Ncookiez/pooltogether-multidelegator-preview)! And [that](https://github.com/Ncookiez/pool-prize-sims)!

Maybe take a look at some documentation I wrote for Snowball [here](https://docs.snowball.network).

Or have a stroll around my contribution history to find even more open-source projects and DAO contributions. And never come back.
