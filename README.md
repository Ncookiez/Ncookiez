### Leave immediately, lest you be exposed to the following:

Take a look at one of my latest projects :cookie:[CookieTrack](https://cookietrack.io). That'll show ya.

The API that powers CookieTrack is open-source, and can be found [here](https://github.com/cookietrack-io/cookietrack-api).

Maybe take a look at the documentation I maintain for Snowball [here](https://docs.snowball.network).

Or have a stroll around my contribution history to find various open-source projects. And never come back.
