### Leave immediately, lest you be exposed to the following:

- :books: Incredibly well structured and documented Node.js repositories.
- :trophy: The best Svelte progressive web apps you've ever seen.

### Still not convinced?

Take a look at one of my latest projects :cookie:[CookieTrack](https://cookietrack.io). That'll show ya.

I'm currently building WeaverFi! Check it out [here](https://github.com/WeaverFi).

Maybe take a look at the documentation I maintain for Snowball [here](https://docs.snowball.network).

Or have a stroll around my contribution history to find various open-source projects and DAO contributions. And never come back.
